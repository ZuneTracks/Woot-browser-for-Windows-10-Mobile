# Woot! Native UWP app

Woot! browser for Windows 10 Mobile is a native Universal Windows Platform app
for browsing Woot! daily deals. It uses a touch-friendly layout with swipeable
category pivots, native deal cards, Woot green accents, light/dark appearance
options, and native offer details.

## Supported feeds

Featured, All, Clearance, Computers, Electronics, Home, Gourmet, Shirts, Sports,
Tools, and Wootoff.

The app loads feed data from `https://developer.woot.com/feed/{feedname}` and
renders titles, subtitles, prices, state, featured status, and images with UWP
controls. Offer links open externally through the system browser; catalog HTML
is not rendered in a WebView.

## Settings

Settings stores the preferred startup category and appearance locally with
`ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings`. The About dialog identifies the app,
version, and ZuneTracks.

API access uses the `x-api-key` request header. For private development builds,
create an ignored `Woot.Uwp\LocalBuildConfiguration.cs` from
`Woot.Uwp\LocalBuildConfiguration.cs.example`; do not commit private keys.
When no private build key is present, the service can use a locally stored
configuration value where supported by the build.

## Build prerequisites

Install Visual Studio 2017 with the **Universal Windows Platform development**
workload and Windows 10 SDK **10.0.15063.0**. Open `Woot.Uwp.sln`, select
`Release | ARM`, then build and deploy to a physical Windows 10 Mobile device.
ARM is the package architecture for Windows 10 Mobile.

The project uses the classic UWP project system and targets Windows Mobile
`10.0.15063.0`. The `Store | ARM` configuration creates a Store-upload
candidate and requires a real Store association before packaging.

## Development signing

Development packages use the `CN=WootDevelopment` certificate. Install the
public `WootDevelopment.cer` on a test device before installing a signed AppX.
Never redistribute the private PFX file. Replace the development identity and
certificate with production signing configuration before distribution.

## Live tile

After a successful Featured feed request or offer visit, the app updates a
foreground live tile with the latest available deal title, price, and Woot
branding. The tile does not poll in the background.
